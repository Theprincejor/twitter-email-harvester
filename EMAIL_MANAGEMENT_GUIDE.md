## Use Cases

### Adding Personal Email Accounts for Warmup
```
/add_emails
â†’ Azuki Campaign
â†’ Warmup Emails
â†’ myemail1@gmail.com, myemail2@gmail.com, myemail3@gmail.com
```

### Adding Monitoring Emails for Checkpoints
```
/add_emails
â†’ Azuki Campaign
â†’ Checkpoint Emails
â†’ monitor@gmail.com, check@gmail.com
```

### Bulk Import from List
Copy your list and paste:
```
john.doe@company.com
jane.smith@company.com
bob.wilson@company.com
alice.johnson@company.com
charlie.brown@company.com
```

## Technical Details

### Storage
Emails are stored in CSV files:
- `templates/[campaign]_warmup.csv`
- `templates/[campaign]_checkpoint.csv`

### Format
CSV structure:
```csv
id,username,name,email
1,john,John Doe,john@test.com
2,jane,Jane Smith,jane@test.com
```

### Parsing Logic
The bot extracts emails using these rules:
1. Split by comma or newline
2. Check for `Name <email>` format
3. Extract email address with `@`
4. Generate username from name or email
5. Auto-increment ID

### Duplicate Detection
- Case-insensitive email comparison
- Existing emails are not duplicated
- Count of skipped duplicates is reported

## Best Practices

### Warmup Emails
- Use 10-20 personal email accounts
- These should be emails you control
- They receive test campaigns first
- Helps establish sender reputation

**Good warmup emails:**
- Your personal Gmail accounts
- Team member emails
- Test accounts you own

### Checkpoint Emails
- Use 2-5 monitoring addresses
- These check if emails reach inbox
- Sent every N emails (e.g., every 10)
- Monitor for spam placement

**Good checkpoint emails:**
- Gmail account (checks Gmail delivery)
- Outlook account (checks Microsoft delivery)
- Custom domain (checks business email delivery)

### Adding Many Emails
For bulk operations:
1. Prepare list in text editor
2. Format as comma-separated or line-separated
3. Copy entire list
4. Paste into Telegram
5. Bot processes all at once

**Limit:** No hard limit, but Telegram messages max ~4000 characters
- ~400 emails per message (if email@test.com format)
- Send multiple messages if needed

## Troubleshooting

### "No valid emails found"
- Make sure emails contain `@` symbol
- Check format: `user@domain.com`
- Remove extra spaces

### Duplicate emails not added
- This is normal behavior
- Duplicates are automatically skipped
- Check `/view_emails` to see existing list

### Changes not taking effect
- Changes apply to NEW campaigns
- Stop and restart campaign to reload
- Or start a new campaign

## Advanced Usage

### Adding with Custom Names
```
Marketing Team <marketing@company.com>,
Support Team <support@company.com>,
Sales Team <sales@company.com>
```

### Importing from Spreadsheet
1. Copy column from Excel/Google Sheets
2. Paste into Telegram
3. Bot auto-detects line breaks

### Testing Email Lists
After adding emails, test the campaign:
1. Set mails per day to 10
2. Enable warmup/checkpoint
3. Monitor delivery
4. Adjust list as needed
